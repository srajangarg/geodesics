1.

	Define problem and refer to paper

2.

	Talk about solution presented by paper, in short, as we have discussed in class
	Brief description of subroutines and data structures used

	DS:

		a map from an edge to a list of intervals
		a heap (set) consisting of pointers to intervals
		a map from each destination point to it's best interval (for traceback)
		a set of unreached destinations

	Subroutines :

		initialize() and mesh_sanity()
		propagate()
		insert_new_interval(), source_bisect()
		get_new_intervals(), prop_thru_interval()

3.
	
	Sample run on test meshes /data2
	Comparing djkitras and MMP window propagation path lengths and time taken

4.	
	Challenges:

		Correct updation and insertion of intervals on an edge
		Corner cases at many places (source_bisect pythogoras case, traceback zero angle/same angle case)
		Handling of traceback (without parent interval pointers)

	Future:

		Storing parent intervals for faster traceback
		Approximate answer by merging adjacent windows
