1.

	Define problem and refer to paper

2.

	Talk about solution presented by paper, in short, as we have discussed in class
	Brief description of subroutines and data structures used

3.
	
	Sample run on test meshes /data2
	Comparing djkitras and MMP window propagation path lengths and time taken

4.	
	Challenges:

		Correct updation and insertion of intervals on an edge
		Corner cases and numerical inaccuracies
		Handling of traceback (without parent interval pointers)

	Future:

		Approximate answer by merging adjacent windows
		Storing parent intervals for faster traceback
